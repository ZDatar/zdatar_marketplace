# ZDatar Marketplace - Task System Implementation

## Overview

The ZDatar Marketplace now includes a comprehensive task system that allows buyers to create data tasks and workers to apply for them. This system supports two main use cases:

1. **Data Labeling Tasks**: Companies like Google, Meta can create tasks for human annotation of their datasets
2. **Data Engineering Tasks**: Buyers with existing datasets can request data processing, visualization, or analysis services

## Features Implemented

### 🎯 Task Creation System
- **Multi-step task creation form** with validation
- **Task type selection**: Data Labeling, Data Engineering, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Data Collection, Data Validation
- **Comprehensive task details**: Budget, timeline, difficulty, requirements
- **Dataset integration**: Support for providing datasets and sample data
- **Skill-based matching**: Required skills specification for better worker matching

### 🔍 Task Discovery & Filtering
- **Advanced filtering system**: By task type, category, difficulty, budget, skills, deadline
- **Search functionality**: Full-text search across task titles and descriptions
- **Sorting options**: By date, budget, deadline, popularity
- **Real-time updates**: Live task feed with pagination

### 💼 Application System
- **Detailed application form**: Proposal, budget, timeline, portfolio links
- **Application management**: Track application status and responses
- **Competitive bidding**: Workers can propose their own budget and timeline
- **Portfolio integration**: Link to previous work and credentials

### 📊 Task Management
- **Status tracking**: Draft, Active, Assigned, In Progress, Under Review, Completed
- **Progress monitoring**: Real-time updates on task completion
- **Rating system**: Post-completion ratings for quality assurance
- **Dispute resolution**: Built-in system for handling conflicts

## Task Types & Categories

### Task Types
- **Data Labeling**: Human annotation and labeling tasks
- **Data Engineering**: ETL, processing, and pipeline development
- **Data Visualization**: Dashboard and chart creation
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and insights
- **Data Collection**: Data gathering and scraping
- **Data Validation**: Quality assurance and verification

### Categories by Task Type
- **Data Labeling**: Image Annotation, Text Labeling, Audio Transcription, Video Annotation
- **Data Engineering**: Data Processing, ETL Pipeline, Database Design
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive Dashboards, Charts, Reports
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling

## Pricing Models

- **Fixed Price**: One-time payment for complete task
- **Hourly Rate**: Payment based on time spent
- **Per Item**: Payment per processed item/record
- **Milestone**: Payment tied to specific deliverables

## Navigation Integration

The task system is fully integrated into the main navigation:
- **Tasks tab** in the main navigation bar
- **Create Task** button prominently displayed
- **Deep linking** support for sharing specific tasks
- **Search integration** in the global search bar

## Key Components

### DataTask Model
```dart
class DataTask {
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final String description;
  final TaskType taskType;
  final TaskCategory category;
  final List<String> requiredSkills;
  final double budget;
  final TaskPricing pricingType;
  final DateTime deadline;
  final TaskDifficulty difficulty;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

### Task Application System
```dart
class TaskApplication {
  final String workerId;
  final double proposedBudget;
  final int proposedTimeframe;
  final String proposal;
  final List<String> portfolioLinks;
  final ApplicationStatus status;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Data Labeling Task
1. Navigate to `/tasks/create`
2. Select "Data Labeling" task type
3. Choose "Image Annotation" category
4. Fill in task details, budget, and requirements
5. Upload dataset or provide dataset URL
6. Specify required skills and deliverables
7. Review and publish

### Applying for a Task
1. Browse tasks at `/tasks`
2. Use filters to find relevant tasks
3. Click on a task to view details
4. Click "Apply for Task"
5. Fill in proposal, budget, and timeline
6. Add portfolio links
7. Submit application

## State Management

The system uses Riverpod for state management with the following providers:

- **`tasksNotifierProvider`**: Manages task list and pagination
- **`taskFiltersProvider`**: Handles filtering and search state
- **`taskCreationProvider`**: Manages task creation process
- **`myTasksProvider`**: Tracks user's created tasks

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time messaging**: Direct communication between buyers and workers
- **Escrow system**: Secure payment handling with milestone releases
- **Reputation system**: Comprehensive rating and review system
- **Team collaboration**: Multi-worker task assignments
- **Advanced analytics**: Task performance and market insights

### Integration Opportunities
- **AI-powered matching**: Automatic worker-task matching based on skills and history
- **Blockchain payments**: Integration with Web3 payment systems
- **NFT certificates**: Task completion certificates as NFTs
- **DAO governance**: Community-driven task dispute resolution

## Technical Notes

### Code Generation Required
The `DataTask` model uses code generation for JSON serialization. Run the following command to generate required files:

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

### Dependencies
The task system leverages existing marketplace dependencies:
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management
- `go_router`: Navigation and routing
- `hive`: Local data storage
- `json_annotation`: Model serialization

### Performance Considerations
- **Pagination**: Tasks are loaded in batches to optimize performance
- **Lazy loading**: Task details are loaded on-demand
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached locally
- **Debounced search**: Search queries are debounced to reduce API calls

## Getting Started

1. **Enable the task system** by navigating to `/tasks`
2. **Create your first task** using the "Create Task" button
3. **Explore filtering options** to find relevant tasks
4. **Apply for tasks** that match your skills
5. **Track progress** through the task management interface
